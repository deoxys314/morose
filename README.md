Morose
======

A small command-line tool to convert text to or from Morse Code.

I mostly wrote this to learn a little more about recursive data structures in
rust.
Hopefully it can be educational for anyone that stumbles across it, but at a
minimum it's functional!

As per the license, feel free to use for whatever you want, so long as you
include the same license.
